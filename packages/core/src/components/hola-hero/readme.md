# hola-hero

Hero is mostly used on home pages and landing pages, which usually contains a slogan, a subtitle and a call-to-action [ghost button](hola-button.md). In Holakit's design, the bottom of hero in extended behind cards after hero.

Of course you can set a background image as the background. With a prop `light-bg` indicating light background image/color, dark text and button will be used to improve contrast.

```html
<!--Use `light-bg` to use dark fonts.-->
<hola-hero light-bg>
  <h1>Holakit</h1>
  <p>Another design-driven UI component set.</p>
  <hola-button ghost>Getting Started</hola-button>
</hola-hero>
```
