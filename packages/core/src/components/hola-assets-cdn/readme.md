# hola-assets-cdn

Use this component to load all assets required by Holakit from CDNs.

In offline situations (users don't have Internet access), you should use `hola-assets-local`.

Particularly, CDN mode may not work for some users in China, since the CDN we use in this element may not have nodes in China or even banned in China.
