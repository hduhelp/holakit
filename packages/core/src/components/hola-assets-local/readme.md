# hola-assets-local

This component loads all Holakit's assets directly from your application, instead of CDNs.

If your application is going to be served in an air-gaped environment, this is a better choice.

Also, we recommend application serving users in China use this element because global CDNs we referenced in `hola-assets-cdn` may not be accessible in China. 

However, if your application is not serving users in China nor will be used in a offline environment, we encourage you to use `hola-assets-cdn`, saving your precious static storage and deliver resources and maybe providing faster assets loading experience.
